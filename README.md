<h1>Problem</h1>

Long integer multiplication could be generalized using problem decomposition strategy. One of the popular method to multiply two n-digit number is Karatsuba. We can multiply two integers in less time complexity. We divide the given numbers in two halves. Let the given numbers be X and Y. Write a code to show how to implement Karatsuba. Show all working and output for each part of multiplications.
